## Overview

This project is a reimplementation of various common shell commands in C, specifically for Linux environments. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how these commands work by coding them from scratch using standard C libraries. Each command is designed to closely mimic its Unix shell counterpart.

## Commands Implemented

- **`pwd`**: Prints the current working directory.
- **`ls`**: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- **`mkdir`**: Creates a new directory.
- **`rmdir`**: Removes an empty directory.
- **`clear`**: Clears the terminal.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Linux Operating System**: The project is intended to run on a Linux environment.
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have `gcc` or any other C compiler installed.
- **Git**: You need Git installed to clone the repository.

### Cloning the Repository

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

## Running the Project

### Compilation

To compile the project, navigate to the `scripts/` directory and run the `compile.sh` script:

```sh
cd scripts/
./compile.sh
```

### Execution
To run the project, execute the run file:

```sh
./run
```

## Usage

Once the program is running, you can enter any of the implemented commands, such as pwd, ls, mkdir, rmdir, etc. Type exit to terminate the shell.
